		End user - the final user of an application, if you are ordering a pizza online, you are the end user of that website<br>
		Administrator - a general term used for people who control the content, and usually permissions, for an application. They are close to an end user, but have much more hands on work with the application than a true end user<br>

  <p>Designing a good admin panel UI is an important part of creating a good website or platform that allows administrators to modify their site quickly and easily. While end users should never see the administrative panel, it is crucial that it is designed well for your administrator clients. There are also a few different factors that should be taken into account when creating an administrative panel, some follow the same goals as those for end users, or the “front end” of the application, but there are some that should be handled differently.
  </p>
	<p>One factor of creating an admin panel that is quite different from the user end, is that your goal is to make the admin panel quick and easy to navigate, to reduce the time that an admin needs to spend in the admin panel. While the end user side of websites are typically created with the intention of retaining users attention and keeping them on the site as long as possible, administrative UI’s should be the opposite. The design should make admins task of going in and editing something as quick as possible, to save their time and patience when doing administrative work. Reducing the number of actions, or time, to complete a task is one of the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/4-golden-rules-ui-design/">4 Golden Rules of UI Design</a> by Nick Babich.
	  </p>
	<p>One very helpful way to speed up admin interactions in the admin panel is to use shortcuts. Admin panels typically have a learning curve, depending on their complexity, and so new admins may want to follow the longer route as they are learning to navigate the admin panel. However, for advanced users who know where they need to go next in their work flow, adding shortcuts to those areas can reduce the time an admin takes to navigate to the next location and make their changes. For example, if the platform is a Learning Management System, and the admin wishes to create a new course and new lessons to add to the course, the general workflow would be to create a course, then create the lessons. If these two areas are separate in the administrative panel, one for creating courses and one for creating lessons, then adding a shortcut from the course being created to the lessons area would be a helpful shortcut. Think of the “View My Cart” options that often appear when you add an item while shopping online. There is typically another route that you can navigate through to find your cart, but the quick pop up with a direct link makes the process much faster, right? 
	  </p>
	<p>This leads into the next goal, which is to take the user workflow into account. When you create a website or platform, there is already a goal in mind for what your admin users will use your site or platform for. One of Rashi Desai’s Do’s from <a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-dos-and-don-ts-of-ux-design-f874d7834b45">The Do’s and Don’ts of UX Design</a> is understanding your users. You will want to take the point of view of the admin when thinking about how to design your admin panel. What will users be creating often, and what will be a one and done or rarely visited section of the admin panel? If they want to make a specific change to their site, where do you think they would look first in the admin panel? Using the same Learning Management System example as before, if an admin is wanting to add content to their site, such as courses, what steps will they take to make those courses, and how can the admin panel be created so that it complements the work required to do that? Making the admin panel be set up in a linear fashion, step by step, in the same order of steps that are required to add or modify content will help simplify your admin panel, and reduce the time it takes an admin to accomplish their task. 
	  </p>
<p>Now that you have an idea on how to structure your admin panel, the design will be the next area to focus on. Most importantly, consistency. As your website or platform evolves with new features and updates, your admin panel will likely expand as well, so that administrators have control over the new features. It is important that as new things are added to the admin panel, they are consistent with what is already there. If a developer adds a section to the admin panel for the new feature they have created, and decides the Save button looks better in a new location, the button might look great in that location, but can be confusing for admins who are used to the Save button being in a different location, interrupting their workflow and detracting from their experience. While they may learn to look for the Save button in a different location, the admin should not need to.
	  </p>
<p>Consistency also helps with recognition rather than recall, number 6 of Jakob Nielsons <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a>. Admins should not have to remember that a Save button or Edit option is located elsewhere when they are in different sections of an admin panel. It is easier for an admin to recognize that they are ready to Save or on the final editing page and know where to click, rather than having to remember where they need to look in order to Save in a certain area of the admin panel. This helps prevent your administrators from becoming “lost” in the settings. Some applications have very in depth customization available, however that comes with the cost of a robust admin panel. Keeping your admin panel consistent will help prevent admins from becoming lost and confused.
	  </p>
<p>Along with consistency should be explanations and confirmations. While involved and/or experienced admins may know what clicking a certain button does, new admins or admins that are not often making edits may not. Having explanations as text or hover messages for options in the admin panel can help admins understand where they are, and what they are doing, or what a certain option will do when it is selected. When admins are making edits to their site, they should never need to guess what changing something or making a selection will do. This can lead to user errors that were avoidable, and cause frustration while increasing the time it took that admin to accomplish their task, which provides a poor UX. Once they have clicked a button or changed a setting that does something, they should be shown some form of confirmation. Be it a pop up window, a small check-mark animation or something else, confirmations help admins know that they have made their edit successfully, and can now move on.
